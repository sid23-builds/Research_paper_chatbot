<h1> RAG chatbot for Research paper</h1>
<p> Created a chatbot that caters to any question you might have related to my Research paper titled: <b>Unvieling the Power of Random Subspace Selection. </b>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L2XxzICznYL1R9UGIqXESjv033dJ1aqL/view?usp=sharing">You can find the paper here </a> </p>

<h2>An overview of the Research paper:</h2>
<li>Evaluated Random Subspace Selection (RSS) across 5+ machine learning algorithms, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reducing overfitting and improving generalization.</li>
<li>Tested RSS on 3+ domain datasets and compared performance of RSS-enabled models against traditional
baselines using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1).</li>
</p>

<h2> Motivation behind the project</h2>
<p> Picked this project as I was interested in undrstanding what AI Agents are and how they work. Came across a technique called Retrieval Augmental Generation(RAG) and thought "Why not use this to understand Ai agents and also preserve something that I spent my final year of college on?" </p>

<h2> Features</h2>
<li>1. Memory is preserved i.e. if you tell the chatbot your name, most probably it will remember you.</li>
<li>2. Makes decision to retrieve/not retrieve the context document on the basis of the input query. I mean a "Hello" can be answered directly right?!</li>
<li>3. LLM used is MistralAI's mistral-large-latest</li>
<li>4. Technologies used: Langchain, Streamlit,Python, RAG</li>

<h2> Working of the chatbot </h2>




<h2>Example input-output Pairs</h2>
1. Acting as a normal chatbot, no retrieval of the context document
