<h1> RAG chatbot for Research paper</h1>
<p> Created a chatbot that caters to any question you might have related to my Research paper titled: <b>Unvieling the Power of Random Subspace Selection. </b>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L2XxzICznYL1R9UGIqXESjv033dJ1aqL/view?usp=sharing">You can find the paper here </a> </p>

<h2>An overview of the Research paper:</h2>
<li>Evaluated Random Subspace Selection (RSS) across 5+ machine learning algorithms, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reducing overfitting and improving generalization.</li>
<li>Tested RSS on 3+ domain datasets and compared performance of RSS-enabled models against traditional
baselines using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1).</li>
</p>

<h2> Motivation behind the project</h2>
<p> I basically got tired of giving answers to questions such as what exactly the research was about, what were the results etc. This is also the time I came across AI agents. Thus,
this started as a thought of progressing towards building AI agents and preserving something that I spent my final year of college on.</p>

<h2> Features</h2>
<li>1. Memory is preserved i.e. if you tell the chatbot your name, most probably it will remember you.</li>
<li>2. Makes decision to retrieve/not retrieve the context document on the basis of the input query. I mean a "Hello" can be answered directly right?!</li>
<li>3. LLM used is MistralAI's mistral-small</li>
<li>4. Technologies used: Langchain, Streamlit</li>
